Excersice 2: Good Morning Sir

Create a python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening. Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')   # this will return time in string format
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')         # so always change it to int before comparing
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%M')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%S')
print(timestamp)
