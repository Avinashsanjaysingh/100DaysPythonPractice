# Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!

m = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
n = int(input("Enter the second Number : "))

print(f"The sum of {m} and {n} is {m+n}.")
print(f"The difference of {m} and {n} is {m-n}.")
print(f"The product of {m} and {n} is {m*n}.")
print(f"The exponential of {m} and {n} is {m**n}.")
print(f"The division of {m} and {n} is {m/n}.")
print(f"The modulus of {m} and {n} is {m%n}.")
print(f"The floor division of {m} and {n} is {m//n}.")
